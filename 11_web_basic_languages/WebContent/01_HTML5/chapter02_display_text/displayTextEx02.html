		1) 태그는 대부분 여는 태그와 닫는 태그로 이루어진다. 하지만 <img> <br>처럼 닫는 태그가 없는 경우도 있다.
		2) 태그는 대소문자를 구별하지 않는다. 하지만 태그와 속성은 모두 소문자로 쓰는 것이 일반적이다.
		3) 빈 공백은 한칸만 인식한다. 
		4) 태그 안에 다른 태그를 포함시킬 수 있다.열고 닫는 태그를 순서와 짝이 맞게 지켜주어야 한다.
		5) 태그 안에 속성을 사용할 수 있다. 태그마다 속성과 속성값이 다르므로 필요에 따라 속성을 익힌다.

	It's 12:45 on a Tuesday, and I don't really care what you say 
	I'm just getting off my face tonight
	'Cause I'm just tryna live to the weekend
	And I don't know how I'm supposed to breathe when
	Everything you say is playing on my mind
	You don't know where I've been and you don't know what I'm drinkin'
	I need a moment to think about nothing at all
	Oh, baby, you gotta stop, I see that you're calling
	I told you that I ain't picking up
	I know that you wanna start
	'Cause we got our problems
	I love you, but I just need a night off
